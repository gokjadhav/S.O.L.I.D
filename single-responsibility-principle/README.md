**Single-responsibility principle :** It states that every class should have a single responsibility,
and that responsibility should be encapsulated by the class. All its services should be narrowly aligned 
with that responsibility.

- The main intent to understand here is, there should be only one reason for a class to change.
- Whenever you find a class or module starts to change for any reasons, think for a moment 
to consider SRP.
